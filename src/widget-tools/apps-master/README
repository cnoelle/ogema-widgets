Parent pom for OGEMA applications, providing default versions for a set of 
OGEMA dependencies (core, widgets, simulations), and some additional libraries.

Deploy to the artifactory:
 1) adapt versions in pom.xml
 2) mvn clean install
 3) mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=ogema-releases::default::https://www.ogema-source.net/artifactory/libs-release-local
 
As usual, step 3) requires the settings.xml file in .m2 to provide access credentials for the artifactory.
Note that the pom.xml deliberately does not contain any deployment repository information, so that applications 
using this as a parent do not try to connect to the OGEMA artifactory for deployment.

Applications who want to use this as a parent need to provide the following pom-entries (adapt version):

    <parent>
        <artifactId>apps-master</artifactId>
        <groupId>org.ogema.apps</groupId>
        <version>2.0.5-alpha-20160701</version>
    </parent>
