/**
 * This package contains a set of widgets for 
 * {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.pattern.ContextSensitivePattern ContextSensitivePatterns},
 * whose context can be initialized via url parameters of the form
 * <code>?key1=value1a,value1b&key2=value2&key3=...</code>
 * The parameters can be set for instance via a 
 * {@link de.iwes.widgets.html.form.button.RedirectButton RedirectButton}.
 * Hence, the context of the widget can be set from another page, which links
 * to the page containing this widget.
 * 
 * The context class must have a default constructor for this to work.
